A Level Project that got me a grade A

My project aims to provide knowledge on the religion of Islam and its history in an enjoyable and interactive way. I intend on achieving this interactivity through a two-player quiz where users can go against friends, testing each other's Islamic knowledge against each other. The program will also include various other game modes. I hope that this aspect of my software will encourage people to learn more about Islam which they can do through the “Learn” feature of the software. This “Learn” feature will allow users to navigate through numerous Islamic topics which will be sorted into various categories and topics. The “Quiz” and “Learn” features will be the two main aspects of my programme
